- When the horizontal ground is detected, the  icon will turn green. After the icon becomes green, you can add the desired object to the horizontal surface by touching it.

- Similarly, when the horizontal background is detected, you can add the dancing character by selecting the desired dance animation by touching the "a" icon.

- The icon "a" will turn green when the camera detects a hand. Once the icon becomes green, you can add the desired planet to your hand by tapping it.

- When the vertical ground is detected, the "a" icon will turn green. After the icon becomes green, you can add the desired wallpaper to the vertical floor by touching it.
